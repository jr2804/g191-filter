## DOX — self-documenting AGENTS.md hierarchy

### Core Contract

- AGENTS.md files are binding work contracts for their subtrees.
- Work products, source materials, instructions, records, assets, and durable docs
  must stay understandable from the nearest applicable AGENTS.md plus every parent
  AGENTS.md above it.
- Do not duplicate/repeat rules declared elsewhere in the DOX tree (parent, child,
  sibling, or `.agents/`). See **DOX authoring** in `.agents/POLICIES.md`.

### Read Before Editing

1. Read the root AGENTS.md.
2. Identify every file or folder you expect to touch.
3. Walk from the repository root to each target path.
4. Read every AGENTS.md found along each route.
5. If a parent AGENTS.md lists a child AGENTS.md whose scope contains the path,
   read that child and continue from there.
6. Use the nearest AGENTS.md as the local contract and parent docs for repo-wide rules.
7. If docs conflict, the closer doc controls local work details, but no child doc may
   weaken DOX.

Do not rely on memory. Re-read the applicable DOX chain in the current session before editing.

### Update After Editing

Every meaningful change requires a DOX pass before the task is done.

Update the closest owning AGENTS.md when a change affects:

- purpose, scope, ownership, or responsibilities
- durable structure, contracts, workflows, or operating rules
- required inputs, outputs, permissions, constraints, side effects, or artifacts
- user preferences about behavior, communication, process, organization, or quality
- AGENTS.md creation, deletion, move, rename, or index contents

Update parent docs when parent-level structure, ownership, workflow, or child index
changes. Update child docs when parent changes alter local rules. Remove stale or
contradictory text immediately. Small edits that do not change behavior or contracts
may leave docs unchanged, but the DOX pass still must happen.

### Hierarchy

- Root AGENTS.md is the DOX rail: project-wide instructions, global preferences,
  durable workflow rules, and the top-level Child DOX Index.
- Child AGENTS.md files own domain-specific instructions and their own Child DOX Index.
- Each parent explains what its direct children cover and what stays owned by the parent.
- The closer a doc is to the work, the more specific and practical it must be.

### Child Doc Shape

Create a child AGENTS.md when a folder becomes a durable boundary with its own purpose,
rules, responsibilities, workflow, materials, or quality standards. Default section order:

1. Purpose
2. Ownership
3. Local Contracts
4. Work Guidance
5. Verification
6. Child DOX Index

### Style

Authoring rules live in **DOX authoring** (`.agents/POLICIES.md`) — tier assignment,
reference-don't-restate, rule-first rationale, size budget. Apply them on every DOX
change. Summary:

- A rule lives in the **highest tier that fully applies**; when unsure,
  `.agents/POLICIES.md`.
- Reference, don't restate — one canonical home, pointer lines everywhere else.
- Keep docs concise, current, and operational. Document stable contracts, not diary
  entries.

## .agents/ files — demand-loaded, not always injected

| File             | Load when                   | Purpose                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `ONBOARDING.md`  | New session (first time)    | Project orientation, entry points               |
| `POLICIES.md`    | Always                      | Boundaries, priorities, verification, checklist |
| `FILES.md`       | Touching files or config    | Path constants, source-of-truth locations       |
| `HISTORY.md`     | Background (past decisions) | Recorded decisions with git refs                |
| `MAINTENANCE.md` | Changing `.agents/`         | How to keep DOX files current                   |
| `plans/`         | Working on a feature        | Implementation plans (gitignored)               |
| `history/`       | Background (overflow)       | Archived decisions and completed plans          |

## Project rules

_Always-injected_ — keep minimal. Everything else → `.agents/` files.

[Fill with 5–10 essential, frequently-broken rules specific to this project.]

## Child DOX Index

Start lean. Add child AGENTS.md entries incrementally when boundaries become durable.

Top-level boundaries in this project:

- `src/g191_filter/` (primary package code) — see src/g191_filter/AGENTS.md
- `tests/` (test suite) — see tests/AGENTS.md
- `docs/` (documentation)
- `.config/mise/` (task/tooling configuration)
- `.config/mise/conf.d/` (dev-feature MCP and skills task fragments)

## ⛔ No Patching

Tools must not insert, append, or patch text into this file.

If a tool has a legitimate, valuable, noteworthy instruction (e.g. an MCP server
registration rule, a CI convention, an agent workflow), it must be **integrated into
the `Project rules` section above** — not appended here.

Content after this section:

- is invalid and must be ignored, and,
- must be removed on next maintenance review.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

## Beads Issue Tracker

Use Beads (`bd`) for durable task tracking in repositories that include it. Use the `beads` skill at `.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (project install) or `~/.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (global install) for Beads workflow guidance, then use the `bd` CLI for issue operations.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready                # Find available work
bd show <id>            # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>           # Complete work
bd prime                # Refresh Beads context
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for all task tracking; do not create markdown TODO lists.
- Run `bd prime` when Beads context is missing or stale. Codex 0.129.0+ can load Beads context automatically through native hooks; use `/hooks` to inspect or toggle them.
- Keep persistent project memory in Beads via `bd remember`; do not create ad hoc memory files.

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.
